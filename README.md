# LinkedListQueuesStacks
This C++ program provides a menu-driven interface for creating and manipulating linked lists, queues, and stacks. The program allows you to:

Create unsorted or sorted linked lists.

Implement FIFO (Queue) and LIFO (Stack) structures.

Perform various operations such as adding, deleting, searching, and displaying elements in the list, queue, and stack.

It uses a custom implementation of a doubly linked list (intdllist) to manage the data. Each of the data structures (List, Queue, Stack) is manipulated using the respective operations that are provided in the menu.


Features:

Unsorted List: Allows you to add elements to the head or tail, delete from the head or tail, and display the list.

Sorted List: Maintains the list in sorted order (increasing), allowing sorted insertion, deletion, and display.

Queue (FIFO): Implements a queue with enqueue (add) and dequeue (remove) operations. The queue is displayed from front to back.

Stack (LIFO): Implements a stack with push (add) and pop (remove) operations. The stack is displayed from top to bottom.

Menu Overview:

Create Simple (Unsorted) List: Allows you to perform various operations on an unsorted list.


Insert at head or tail.

Delete from head or tail.

Search for and delete a specific element.

Display the list from head to tail.

Create Sorted List: Allows you to perform operations on a sorted list (increasing order).


Insert in sorted order.

Search and delete an element.

Display the sorted list.

Create Queue (FIFO): Implements FIFO queue operations.


Enqueue (add an element to the queue).

Dequeue (remove an element from the front of the queue).

Display the current queue.

Create Stack (LIFO): Implements LIFO stack operations.

Push (add an element to the stack).
Pop (remove an element from the top of the stack).
Display the current stack.
Exit Program: Exit the program.
